Explanation: To invoke my lab1.py file, first I wrote the code in Jupyter Notebook using function "print" with the command "Wecome to DSCI520!" in the parentheses and double quotation marks after "print". Then I downloaded the file as Python(.py) to my laptop. After that, I uploaded the lab1.py file to my repository and clicked commit change. When the grader wants to open the file, he/she just needs to click the file name and there shows the code.
